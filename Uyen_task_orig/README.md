# Uyen_FCC_work

<strong> <h2> Description </h2> </strong>  

Analysis here was done as part of a short-term task for Uyen Tran, a grad student at Chicago Booth (as of April 2021). Further information on the specific technical details of the project can be found in WRITEUP.md. 
  
The major thing to note is that in the folder ***FCC data/*** and **Block Data/us2019/**, due to limited bandwidth, I have not been able to upload the zip files for those folders. However, you can download them at these links: <a href = "https://www.fcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-477">FCC</a> and <a href = "https://www.fcc.gov/file/19314/download">Block Data</a>. This information is also provided in info.txt in the aforementioned folders. 
Here is the list of versions that I used. 

***FCC Data***

Ideally you should download these files and unzip them in the ***FCC data/*** folder or modify the code accordingly although I understand this may be difficult. 

December 2014 version 3, June 2015 version 5, December 2015 version 4, June 2016 version 4, December 2016 version 2, June 2017 version 3, December 2017 version 3, June 2018 version 1, December 2018 version 3, June 2019 version 2. 

You'll notice that the pattern is that I just download the latest available information for the most up to date data. We want the Satellite data. 

***US2019***

Data file provides housing unit, household and population counts for each block for 2010 (US Census) and 2019 (Commission staff estimate). The link provided above downloads file directly for you. Ideally you should download the file into this folder **Block Data/us2019/**.
